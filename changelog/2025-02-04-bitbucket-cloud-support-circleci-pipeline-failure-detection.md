### Bitbucket Cloud Support & CircleCI Pipeline Failure Detection

We're excited to announce two major updates:

#### Bitbucket Cloud Integration

CodeRabbit is now available for Bitbucket Cloud users! This integration includes:

- Automated code reviews for pull requests
- Inline review comments and suggestions
- Real-time bot interaction for feedback and assistance

Check out our [Bitbucket Cloud integration guide](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/platforms/bitbucket-cloud) to get started.

#### [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) Pipeline Failure Detection and Remediation

We've expanded our pipeline error detection to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)! Just like with GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, you can now automatically detect and fix pipeline failures from your CircleCI workflows.
