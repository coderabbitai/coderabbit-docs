### Docstring Path Instructions

You can now provide path-based instructions for the generation of docstring in `.coderabbit.yaml`.

Example:

```yaml
code_generation:
  docstrings:
    path_instructions:
      - path: "**/*.ts"
        instructions: |
          End all docstrings with a notice that says "Auto-generated by CodeRabbit.".
          Do not omit the closing tags; the docstring must be valid.
```

See the [docstrings documentation](/finishing-touches/docstrings#path-instructions) for more details.
