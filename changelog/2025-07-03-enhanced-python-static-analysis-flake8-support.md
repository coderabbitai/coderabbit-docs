### Enhanced Python Static Analysis: Flake8 Support

We're excited to announce enhanced Python static analysis capabilities with [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) support!

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) is a Python linting utility that wraps PyFlakes, pycodestyle, and Mccabe to check your Python code for style and logical errors.

See our [tools documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/) for more details.
