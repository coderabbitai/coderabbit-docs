### Enhanced Python Static Analysis: nbqa Support for Jupyter Notebooks

We're excited to announce enhanced Python static analysis capabilities with nbqa support for Jupyter Notebooks!

Our existing integrated [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) and [Pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/) tools now support linting Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files) using [nbqa](https://github.com/nbQA-dev/nbQA). This allows you to maintain code quality across your Python projects, including Jupyter Notebooks.

See our [Ruff](/tools/ruff), [Flake8](/tools/flake8), and [Pylint](/tools/pylint) documentation for more details.
