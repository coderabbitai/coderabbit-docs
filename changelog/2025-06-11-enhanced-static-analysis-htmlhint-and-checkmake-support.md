### Enhanced Static Analysis: HTMLHint and Checkmake Support

We're excited to announce that two new static analysis tools are now supported on CodeRabbit!

- [HTMLHint](https://htmlhint.com/) is a static code analysis tool for HTML that helps maintain code quality by detecting common mistakes and enforcing best practices.

- [Checkmake](https://github.com/mrtazz/checkmake) is a linter for Makefiles that helps ensure your build scripts follow best practices and maintain consistency.
