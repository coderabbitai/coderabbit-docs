### GitHub Action Failure Detection and Remediation

We're excited to announce our new pipeline error detection tool. Never let a failing pipeline block your progress again!

Automatically fix build failures for GitHub Actions! This feature automatically identifies common pipeline and build failures, providing instant fixes across multiple technologies such Python, Node.js, Java, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes and more!

Key capabilities:

- Automatic detection and analysis of pipeline build failures
- One-click fix build failure suggestions for common issues
- Comprehensive support for popular frameworks and tools
- Integration with existing GitHub Checks

Future support planned for:

- Azure DevOps CI/CD
- GitLab CI/CD
- CircleCI
