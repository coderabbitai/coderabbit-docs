### Related PRs and Label suggestions

- **Possibly Related PRs**: The walkthrough comment now provides a list of potentially related PRs, helping you quickly recall relevant context from past work.
- **Suggested labels**: CodeRabbit can now suggest labels by learning from your past PRs in the walkthrough comment. You can also provide custom labeling instructions in the UI or via configuration file.

> Note: Possibly related PRs, automatic label suggestions based on past PRs, learnings, and possibly related issues require data opt-in (enabled by default).
