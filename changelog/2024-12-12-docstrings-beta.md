### Docstrings (Beta)

We have launched a new functionality as part of our finishing touches initiative to allow developers to generate docstrings on a pull request. This feature lets you generate docstrings by commenting `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` on any pull request. This works for both new and existing documentation. See [our documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for details.
