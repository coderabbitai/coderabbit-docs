### Enhanced PHP Static Analysis: PHPMD and PHPCS Support

We're excited to announce enhanced PHP static analysis capabilities with two powerful new tools!

- [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/) (PHP Mess Detector) is a static analysis tool that detects potential problems in your PHP code such as possible bugs, suboptimal code, overcomplicated expressions, and unused parameters, variables, methods, and classes.

- [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) (PHP CodeSniffer) is a development tool that ensures your PHP code conforms to coding standards like PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-12, and custom standards. It can automatically fix many coding standard violations.

See our [tools documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/) for more details.
