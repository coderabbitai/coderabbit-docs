### Enhanced Static Analysis: Dotenv Linter and Pylint Support

We're excited to announce that two new static analysis tools are now supported on CodeRabbit!

- [Dotenv Linter](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter) is a fast, opinionated linter for `.env` files that helps prevent misconfigurations by detecting typos, invalid syntax, and duplicated keys.

- [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) is a widely used static analysis and code quality tool for Python. It checks for errors, enforces coding standards, and looks for code smells in your Python codebase.
