### Docstrings

```mdx-code-block
<ProPlanNotice />
```

We're excited to announce the launch of the Docstrings feature! This functionality allows developers to generate docstrings on a pull request. By commenting `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` on any pull request, you can automatically generate docstrings for functions in the code changes.

The list of supported languages and software forges is available in [the documentation](/finishing-touches/docstrings).

### Azure DevOps Pipeline Failure Detection

We're excited to announce that our pipeline error detection capabilities now extend to Azure DevOps! Just like with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, and CircleCI, you can now automatically detect and fix pipeline failures in your Azure DevOps pipelines.
