### Security and SAST Remediation Improvements

- Enabling comprehensive security analysis directly from context within GitHub Checks.
- CodeRabbit now seamlessly integrates with top SAST tools that create github check annotation comments such as: Codacy, SonarCloud, Code Climate, GitHub Advanced Security, Palo Alto Prisma Cloud, and more!
- We have added a [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfy3FdsoUtU) for a step-by-step guide on using CodeRabbit with Codacy and SonarCloud during pull requests.
- Improved the [Semgrep Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/semgrep).
- CodeRabbit now automatically detects Semgrep rulesets from default `semgrep.yml` or `semgrep.config.yml` files, eliminating the need for manual configuration.
