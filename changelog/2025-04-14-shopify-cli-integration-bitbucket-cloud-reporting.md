### Shopify CLI Integration & Bitbucket Cloud Reporting

We're excited to announce two significant updates:

#### Shopify CLI Integration

We've added support for [Shopify CLI](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/shopify-cli), a powerful tool for validating and analyzing Shopify themes and apps. This integration helps ensure your Shopify projects follow best practices by:

- Validating Liquid syntax and theme requirements
- Checking app extension configurations
- Identifying performance bottlenecks
- Ensuring accessibility standards
- Detecting security vulnerabilities

#### Bitbucket Cloud Scheduled Reporting

Our reporting capabilities now extend to Bitbucket Cloud! You can now:

- Schedule automated reports for your Bitbucket Cloud repositories
- Generate customized summaries of team performance
- Track PR review metrics
- Deliver reports via Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord
