### Support for On-premises Learning and GitLab Follow-up Issue Creation

Learnings enable developers to fine-tune the AI for their specific files, repositories, and codebase, enhancing future reviews. We're excited to extend this feature to our on-premises customers. Additionally, we've improved our automated workflow to create follow-up issues directly from Merge Request reviews in GitLab.
