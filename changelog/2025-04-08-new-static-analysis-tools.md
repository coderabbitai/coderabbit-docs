### New Static Analysis Tools

We've expanded our static analysis capabilities with two new tools:

- **Oxlint**: A high-performance JavaScript/TypeScript linter written in Rust.
- **Prisma Lint**: A dedicated linter for Prisma schema files to help enforce consistent conventions and best practices.

Both tools can be configured through their respective config files or through CodeRabbit's settings page. See our [tools documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/tools/) for more details.
