### Agent Chat

```mdx-code-block
<ProPlanNotice />
```

We're thrilled to introduce agentic planning on GitHub for CodeRabbit chat as Generally Available for Pro users. This enhancement lets you make more advanced requests that span multiple files. Just add a review or issue comment on any pull request, or issue comment on an issue, issue tagging `@coderabbitai` along with your natural language request for a code change, and the chat will develop a plan for complex modifications. Upon reviewing the plan and getting your consent, CodeRabbit will emit a stacked PR, commit or copyable snippet to your PR or issue for those code changes.
