### ESLint Support

We're excited to announce support for **ESLint**, now extending to .vue, .svelte, and .astro files, in addition to the traditional .js, .ts, and .jsx extensions. We've enhanced compatibility for monorepos, offering improved integration with Yarn and Pnpm workspaces for seamless project management.

Our solution respects your existing ESLint configurations, requiring only that all dependencies are properly defined in your package.json. Please note that private plugins are not yet supported. We're dedicated to streamlining code quality maintenance and making it as efficient as possible across your web development projects.
