### New Features and Improvements

#### Review Settings

Users can now select between **Chill** and **Assertive** review tones to tailor feedback styles according to their preferences. The **Assertive** profile posts more comments and nitpicks the code more aggressively, while the **Chill** profile is more relaxed and posts fewer comments.

#### More Static Analysis Support

We are continually expanding our support for static analysis tools. We've recently added support for

- Biome
- Hadolint
- ast-grep.

Update your .coderabbit.yaml file or visit the settings page to enable or disable the tools you wish to use.

#### Tone Settings

Users can now personalize CodeRabbit to review code in the style of their favorite characters or personalities. Here are a few of our top examples:

- Mr. T: "You must talk like Mr. T in all your code reviews. I pity the fool who doesn't!"
- Pirate: "Arr, matey! Ye must talk like a pirate in all yer code reviews. Yarrr!"
- Snarky Ex-Girlfriend: "You must talk like a snarky ex-girlfriend in all your code reviews. You're welcome."

#### Revamped Settings Page

We have redesigned the settings page for a more intuitive layout, enabling users to find and adjust settings quickly. This change was long-time coming; it not only improves the user experience but also allows our development team to add more settings in the future with ease. Going forward, the changes to .coderabbit.yaml will be reflected in the settings page, and vice versa.
