### Multiple Features Release

#### Learnings

CodeRabbit can now learn from your conversations to fine-tune your reviews. If you encounter inaccurate feedback or something not relevant to your codebase, just let the bot know, and it will remember the context for the future. We understand that coding practices and standards evolve. Using the chat, you can inform the bot, and it will remove any existing learnings that are no longer relevant. This feature does not work if you have opted out of data storage.

#### Codebase Verification

Verifies the reference of the changes on the overall codebase and identifies missing changes.

#### Jira and Linear Integrations

You can now integrate Jira and Linear with CodeRabbit to provide additional context when reviewing pull requests. If you use either of these systems, we highly recommend enabling this integration for a more seamless experience. Stay tunedâ€”more integrations are coming soon!

#### Related Issues

Identifies all issues affected by the code changes. This helps understand the impact on the overall product. It also assists in identifying duplicate issues or the impact on any other existing issues. This feature is unavailable for users who have opted out of data collection.
