![Granting permission to organization](../../static/img/getting-started/grant-permission.png)

This will grant CodeRabbit access to the selected organization, allowing it to:

- Read organization and team membership
- Read organization projects
- Access user email addresses (read-only)

> Note: Organizations control which applications are allowed to access their private data. You may need organization admin approval to complete this process.
