### Comparison with Other Tools

> Code reviews remain essential, whether the code is written by a human or a bot. This is mainly because the perspective of the reviewer differs from that of the code generator, whether human or machine. This distinction is precisely why human peer reviews have been effective for so long. While AI-powered code-generation tools like GitHub Copilot hold immense potential, it's important to recognize that these generators are still in their early stages and may not be equipped to auto-generate meaningful code for moderately complex applications.

#### vs AI Code Generators

- Provides review perspective different from code generation
- Complements tools like GitHub Copilot
- Focuses on code quality and best practices

#### vs Traditional Review Tools

- Context-aware feedback
- Actionable suggestions
- Direct commit capabilities
- AI-powered intent understanding
