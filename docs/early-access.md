# Early Access Program

In CodeRabbit's dashboard, in the settings of a repository, there is the **Early Access** toggle, which enables early access features. Early access is divided into two categories: **Beta** and **Experiments**. Both are enabled by the same toggle but should be differentiated by a warning whenever they are used.

## Beta

Beta features are ready for public testing.

- The documentation may be incomplete or outdated.
- The changelog may be missing.
- The feature may not be fully stable.
- Edge cases may not be fully covered.
- Some parts of the feature may not be implemented.
- They may not represent the end result of the planned feature and may not have a satisfactory user experience.

Whenever you use a beta feature, you may see a warning like this:

:::warning
This feature is in [beta](/early-access#beta).
:::

## Experiments

Experiments are ways for CodeRabbit's development team to gather more experience with in-development features.

- They are highly unstable and may not work at all.
- There is no guarantee that they will reach the beta stage and they may be cancelled at any time without any prior notice.
- They are not ready for public use and may not be sufficiently documented.
- We are not gathering feedback for experiments - the direction they take can vary widely.

Whenever you use an experiment, you may see a warning like this:

:::warning
This feature is [experimental](/early-access#experiments).
