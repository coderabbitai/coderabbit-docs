# Docstrings

Docstrings generation is part of the [finishing touches](/future-development#finishing-touches).

## Usage

Once you are done with your pull request and its reviews, you may want to perform finishing touches to your code, such as adding in-code documentation. You can request CodeRabbit to generate docstrings by typing `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` in a comment under that pull request.

Once sent, CodeRabbit will perform the following actions:

- All functions that are in the pull request's changes will be fetched using `ast-grep`
- Docstrings will be generated for the functions where they are missing or incomplete
- These docstrings will be committed in a new branch in the same repository
- CodeRabbit will open a pull request from this new branch to the existing pull request

Here's an example of what a pull request may look like:

![Docstrings PR](/img/finishing-touches/docstrings-pull-request.png)

CodeRabbit cannot perform further modifications to opened pull requests. From there, it's your turn to checkout the branch and improve it to satisfaction. We believe that this workflow provides a significant headstart to documenting code.

This feature has been rigorously tested and is now available for all Pro plan users. Additionally, you can provide feedback about this feature on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1134356397673414807/1317286905557287022).

## Path Instructions

You can customize the generated docstrings by providing instructions based on file paths in your `.coderabbit.yaml`. The `path` is a [minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) pattern.

```yaml
code_generation:
  docstrings:
    path_instructions:
      - path: "**/*.ts"
        instructions: |
          End all docstrings with a notice that says "Auto-generated by CodeRabbit.".
          Do not omit the closing tags; the docstring must be valid.
```

## Supported software forges

These software forges are supported:

- Azure DevOps
- GitHub
- GitLab

While Bitbucket is not officially supported, docstrings can still be generated. However, they will be posted in a comment under the pull request. Full support for Bitbucket is planned.

## Supported languages

These languages are supported:

- Bash
- C
- C#
- C++
- Elixir
- Go
- Java
- JavaScript
- Kotlin
- Lua
- Php
- Python
- React TypeScript
- Ruby
- Rust
- Swift
- TypeScript

CodeRabbit uses `ast-grep` to parse the code. If you want a new language to be supported, please look into [Add New Language to ast-grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/contributing/add-lang.html#add-new-language-to-ast-grep) first.
