[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is a static code analysis tool for Python that wraps PyFlakes (error detection), pycodestyle (PEP 8 style rules) and McCabe (cyclomatic-complexity measurement) to catch a wide range of issues in a single pass.

## Supported Files

Flake8 runs on files with the following extension:

- `*.py`

## Features
Flake8 can detect many issues, including:

- PEP 8 style-guide violations
- Unused or re-defined variables and imports
- Undefined names / variables
- Cyclomatic-complexity over threshold (defaultÂ 10)
- Error-prone constructs (e.g., comparison to literal True / False)
- Select / ignore rule filtering (--select, --extend-ignore)
- Extensible plugin ecosystem and custom rule support
