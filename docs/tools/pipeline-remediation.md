## Overview

Are pipeline failures holding up your pull requests? Is your latest code failing to build for no apparent reason? CodeRabbit's Pipeline Failure Remediation tool automatically detects and fixes build failures across your CI/CD pipelines.

Our intelligent system analyzes pipeline failures in real-time, providing inline comments and actionable suggestions to quickly resolve issues. We support multiple CI/CD platforms and integrate with popular security scanning tools to provide comprehensive remediation guidance.

## Supported Platforms

### GitHub Actions

- Automatic detection of workflow failures
- Inline fixes for common build issues
- Integration with GitHub Checks
- Support for custom actions and workflows

### GitLab CI/CD

- Pipeline failure analysis
- Integration with GitLab Advanced Security
- Support for DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) findings
- Remediation for SAST (Static Application Security Testing) issues

### CircleCI

- Workflow failure detection
- Job-level error analysis
- Configuration validation
- Dependency resolution

## Common Use Cases

Our tool handles a wide range of pipeline failures including:

### Build Failures

- Docker build issues
- Node.js dependency conflicts
- Java compilation errors
- Python package resolution
- Go module management

### Infrastructure as Code

- Kubernetes manifest validation
- Terraform template errors
- CloudFormation stack issues
- Ansible playbook failures

### Security Pipeline Integration

- SAST finding remediation
- DAST vulnerability fixes
- Dependency scanning
- Container security

### Testing Failures

- Unit test failures
- Integration test errors
- End-to-end test issues
- Performance test threshold violations

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: CodeRabbit monitors your pipeline runs and automatically detects failures
2. **Analysis**: Our AI analyzes the failure logs and context to determine the root cause
3. **Remediation**: We provide inline suggestions and automated fixes where possible
4. **Learning**: The system learns from successful fixes to improve future recommendations

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regular dependency updates help prevent build failures
2. **Use Lock Files**: Lock files ensure consistent builds across environments
3. **Implement Caching**: Proper caching strategies speed up builds and reduce failures
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to prevent timeouts
5. **Maintain Clean Tests**: Well-maintained tests reduce false positives
