# Why CodeRabbit?

Looking back at CodeRabbit's journey, our fundamental mission remains unchanged:

> To build the best code review experience in the cloud

This is our core mission today. It's clear to us that as development teams grow and codebases become more complex, manual code reviews become increasingly challenging and time-consuming. No one wants to spend hours reviewing code when they could be building features.

## Real-World Code Reviews

> CodeRabbit currently processes [Over 470,000 pull requests](https://github.com/search?q=coderabbitai&type=pullrequests) across multiple languages including TypeScript, Go, Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, C#, and PHP.

## The Problem With Traditional Code Reviews

As engineering teams scale, several critical issues emerge:

1. **Review Latency** - PRs often sit for days waiting for review, blocking feature delivery
2. **Inconsistent Quality** - Different code reviewers focus on different aspects
3. **Knowledge Silos** - Critical insights stay trapped with individual code reviewers
4. **Context Switching** - Developers lose focus when reviewing large PRs
5. **Scale Limitations** - Senior developers become review bottlenecks

## CodeRabbit is AI-Powered

CodeRabbit leverages advanced AI to provide intelligent, context-aware code reviews.

Our AI engine understands not just the syntax, but the intent and context of code changes. This enables reviews that go beyond simple style checks to provide meaningful insights about:

- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations
- Design patterns
- Best practices
- Documentation completeness
