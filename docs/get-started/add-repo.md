Learn how to add CodeRabbit to your GitHub or GitLab repositories.

To add additional repositories after the sign-up, go to the repositories page within the CodeRabbit UI.

Click on the "**Add repositories**" button. Upon clicking, you'll be redirected to GitHub.

Upon successful installation, you will be automatically redirected back to the CodeRabbit UI. Here, you can view the list of repositories that CodeRabbit now has access to.

:::note

For **GitLab** the flow is slightly different. All the repositories display by default and you can toggle and enable the ones where the CodeRabbit app should be installed.
