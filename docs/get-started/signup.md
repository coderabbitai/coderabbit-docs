After you have installed the CodeRabbit app, the reviews will start
automatically with the new pull requests or incremental commits to existing pull
requests. To trigger reviews on existing pull requests, post "@coderabbitai
review" as a comment on the pull request.

:::tip The automatic code review behavior can be changed to "On-Demand". To make
this change, go to the repository settings in the UI or modify the appropriate
setting in the YAML file to disable reviews. :::
