## Overview

This page is about using the CodeRabbit API to generate on-demand reports about your organization's usage of CodeRabbit. For a conceptual overview of reports in CodeRabbit, see [Generate reports](/guides/reports-overview).

If you're new to CodeRabbit's reporting features, then we recommend starting with [Scheduled reports](/guides/scheduled-reports) to understand the available options and capabilities. In almost every scenario we recommend using the **Scheduled Reports** option. The **On-demand Report** does not have any additional benefits from the **Scheduled Reports** and has many limitations.

## API Access

CodeRabbit offers a way to generate on-demand reports using the [CodeRabbit API](https://api.coderabbit.ai/api/swagger/).
You will need an API Key to access the CodeRabbit API and generate an on-demand report.

## Create an API key

Sign in to your CodeRabbit account and navigate to the [**API Keys**](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/api-keys) page under 'Organization Settings' in the left sidebar.
Click on the **Create API Key** button and enter a name for the API Key.
Copy the API key, and keep it safe as it won't be visible again.

## Generate an On-demand report

Once you have the API key, pass it in the `x-coderabbitai-api-key` header when calling the API:

```sh
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://api.coderabbit.ai/api/v1/report.generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'x-coderabbitai-api-key: cr-xxxxxxxxxxxxx' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "from": "2024-05-01",
    "to": "2024-05-15"
  }'
```

Sample output:

```sh
[
  {
    "group": "Developer Activity",
    "report": "*Developer Activity*:\n\n ðŸŸ¢ **Update README.md** [#10](https://gitlab.com/master-group123/sub-group/project1/-/merge_requests/10)\nâ€¢ Summary: The change updates the project description and modifies a section header for clearer instructions.\nâ€¢ Last activity: 1 day ago, mergeable\nâ€¢ Insights:\n - :magnifying_glass: @user2 Suggested updating the wording to make it clearer"
  }
]
```

:::info

If you get a 401 UNAUTHORIZED error, check if you're passing the right API key in the `x-coderabbitai-api-key` header

The on-demand report generation endpoints take in inputs as per the schema shown below:

```mdx-code-block
<ReportSchema />
```
