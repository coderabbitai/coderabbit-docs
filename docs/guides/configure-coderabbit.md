CodeRabbit offers various configuration options to tailor the reviews to your
requirements. Configuration can be made using one of the below options :

1. **Configure using CodeRabbit YAML File** _(Recommended)_
2. **Configure using CodeRabbit UI**

Configuration defined in the YAML file overrides the settings in the UI.

### 1. Configure CodeRabbit using a YAML File {#yaml}

You can add a `.coderabbit.yaml` configuration file to the root of your
repositories. Below is a sample YAML file that can be used as a starting point
and changed as needed:

#### version 2: `Current`

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json
language: "en-US"
early_access: false
reviews:
  profile: "chill"
  request_changes_workflow: false
  high_level_summary: true
  poem: true
  review_status: true
  collapse_walkthrough: false
  auto_review:
    enabled: true
    drafts: false
chat:
  auto_reply: true
```

YAML settings:

1. **`language`**: Set the language for reviews using the ISO language code. For
   example, `"ja"` configures reviews in Japanese.
2. **`tone_instructions`**: Set the tone for the reviews and the chat. Example:
   'You must use talk like Mr. T. I pity the fool who doesn't!'
3. **`early_access`**: Enroll in the early access program to take advantage of
   forthcoming features before their general release (default:`false`).
4. **`enable_free_tier`**: Enable the free tier features for users who are not
   subscribed to a paid plan (default:`true`).
5. **`reviews`**: Configures review settings.

   - **`profile`**: Select the reviewer profile between `assertive` and `chill`.
     The `assertive` profile posts more comments and nitpicks the code more
     aggressively, while the `chill` profile is more relaxed and posts fewer
     comments. (default: `chill`).
   - **`request_changes_workflow`**: Enable request changes review workflow for
     CodeRabbit reviews. (default: `false`).
   - **`high_level_summary`**: CodeRabbit generates a high-level summary of the
     changes in the PR/MR description. (default:`true`).
   - **`high_level_summary_placeholder`**: Placeholder in the PR/MR description
     that gets replaced with the high-level summary.
     (default:`@coderabbitai summary`).
   - **`poem`**: Indicates whether a creative poem should be included in the
     review (default:`true`).
   - **`review_status`**: Include a review status when a review is skipped in
     certain cases. (default:`true`).
   - **`collapse_walkthrough`**: Collapses the walkthrough comment
     (default:`false`).
   - **`path_filters`**: Specifies file patterns to exclude or include for a
     review, such as `!dist/**` and `src/**.tsx`, using glob notation. Example:

     ```yaml
     reviews:
       path_filters:
         - "!**/*.xml"
         - "!**/generated/**"
     ```

   - **`path_instructions`**: Provides specific additional guidelines for code
     review based on file paths. In the given example, JavaScript files are
     singled out for checks against the Google JavaScript style guide. File path
     accepts glob pattern. Example:

     ```yaml
     reviews:
       path_instructions:
         - path: "**/*.js"
           instructions:
             "Review the JavaScript code for conformity with the Google
             JavaScript style guide, highlighting any deviations."
         - path: "tests/**/*"
           instructions:
             "Assess the unit test code employing the Mocha testing framework.
             Test descriptions must be sufficiently detailed to clarify the
             purpose of each test."
     ```

   - **`auto_review`**: Manages settings for automated code reviews.

     - **`enabled`**: Automated code review (default: `true`).
     - **`ignore_title_keywords`**: Review will be ignored if a pull request
       title contains one of the list of keywords (case-insensitive).

       the list of labels (case-insensitive).
     - **`drafts`**: Determines whether draft pull requests are reviewed
       (default: `true`).
     - **`base_branches`**: A list of base branches for which the reviews will
       trigger, apart from the default branch. Accepts regex pattern. Example:

     ```yaml
     reviews:
       auto_review:
         base_branches:
           - develop
           - feat/.*
     ```

         you might only find useful when checking formal text.
       - **`enabled_rules`**: IDs of rules to be enabled. The rule won't run

       - **`enabled_categories`**: IDs of categories to be enabled.
       - **`disabled_categories`**: IDs of categories to be disabled.

### 2. Configure CodeRabbit through the UI

Reviews can also be configured through the UI under repository settings:

---

### Review Configuration

**Path-based instructions :** Provide additional review guidelines based on the
file paths using glob patterns.

For further guidance, please refer to this
section [Review Instructions](./review-instructions.md).

**Language Selection:** Select the natural language in which you want the review
feedback. CodeRabbit supports most of the widely used languages. The default
language is English.

**Disable High-Level Summary:** This allows disabling the high-level summary
added with the pull request description.

---

### Review Filters

**Disable Reviews:** Disables automatic code reviews for the repository. Reviews
can be initiated on-demand using CodeRabbit commands.

**Enable draft pull request reviews:** Select whether CodeRabbit should review
the draft pull requests.

**Configure reviews using pull request labels:** Select specific pull request
labels for which reviews should occur.

**File Pattern:** Include or exclude specific file patterns from the review.

Please note that code reviews commence with new pull requests or incremental
commits to existing pull requests once the CodeRabbit app is installed. Should
you have any questions or require assistance, our support team is here to help.
