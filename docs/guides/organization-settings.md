This page is about managing the default settings of CodeRabbit for your
organization. For a general overview of configuring CodeRabbit, see [Configure CodeRabbit](/guides/configuration-overview).

## About organization settings {#about}

You can use the CodeRabbit web interface to set the default CodeRabbit configuration
for all Git repositories associated with your organization. There are two reasons
to review and set your organizational settings:

- When you give CodeRabbit access to a new repository, CodeRabbit applies all of your
  organizational settings to that repository as defaults.
- Some settings, such as [Data retention], apply only at the organizational level, with
  no per-repository equivalent.

## Browse and modify your organization settings {#modify}

To view or modify your organizational settings, follow these steps:

1. Visit [the CodeRabbit web interface](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/repositories).
1. In the sidebar, click **Organization Settings** > **Configuration**.
1. Browse and modify the settings as needed. If you do make changes, click **Apply Changes** when you are finished.
