## Setting Up a Recurring Report

2. Click **Create Report**
3. Configure the following settings:

### Schedule Configuration

![Schedule Configuration](/img/guides/report-params.png)

The schedule configuration allows you to set precise timing for your reports:

#### Frequency Options

- **Days of Week**

  - Select any combination of days (Sun-Sat)
  - Set frequency (every 1-3 weeks)
  - Ideal for weekly team syncs or sprint reviews

- **Days of Month**
  - Select specific dates (1-31)
  - Special date handling:
    - 31st: Runs on the last day of every month
    - 30th: Skips February
    - 29th: Only runs in February during leap years

#### Time Settings

- Set specific time for report generation
- Choose from comprehensive timezone list (e.g., America/New_York)
- Reports run at the specified time in the selected timezone

:::tip Timezone Consideration
Choose a time that works for all team members, especially for distributed teams across different time zones.
:::

### Report Parameters

Reports can be filtered using multiple parameters:

- **Repositories**: Select specific repositories to monitor
- **Labels**: Filter by GitHub labels with operators:
  - IN: Match any selected label
  - ALL: Match all selected labels
- **Users**: Filter by specific GitHub users
- **Teams**: Filter by organization teams
  - Note: Team filtering is not available for GitLab repositories

:::note Parameter Configuration
Each parameter can be:

- Added or removed as needed
- Combined with other parameters for precise filtering
- Modified using different operators
  :::

### Report Content

Reports include comprehensive PR information:

- PR metadata:
  - Title and description
  - Creation and last activity dates
  - Status (merged, mergeable, draft)
  - State (open, closed, merged)
- Collaboration details:
  - Labels and reviewers
  - Comments and discussions
  - Team associations
- Repository context
- Author information

:::info Stale PR Detection
PRs are marked as stale after 168 hours (7 days) of inactivity. This helps identify potential workflow bottlenecks.
:::

### Report Templates

CodeRabbit offers several built-in templates:

1. **Daily Standup Report**: A concise summary of pull requests and activities.
2. **Sprint Report**: A structured overview of sprint goals, completed tasks, in-progress work, and blockers.
3. **Release Notes**: A high-level changelog with summary and significant changes.
4. **[Custom Templates](custom-reports.md)**: Create your own format using prompts. Allows for endless customization such as native language reporting (Japanese, Spanish, French, etc.), custom formatting, custom titles, and more.

Example custom prompt:

```text
Please provide a summary of:
- All pull request activities
- Related issues and comments
- Code review discussions
- Quality gate status

Do not include:
- Bot conversations
- Sequence diagrams
```

### Communication Channels

Configure where your reports will be delivered:

![Report Delivery Platforms](/img/guides/report-platforms.png)

#### Email

- Enter individual email addresses
- Use distribution lists for team-wide delivery

#### Slack/Discord

1. Connect your workspace through OAuth
2. Select target channels
3. CodeRabbit bot will be installed automatically

#### Microsoft Teams

## Managing Reports

### Preview Reports

Test your configuration using the **Preview Report** button to generate a sample report instantly.

### Grouping Options

Reports can be organized hierarchically using groups and subgroups:

#### Primary Grouping

Select from these options to organize your main report structure:

- **None**: No grouping, flat list of items
- **Repository**: Group by source repository
- **Label**: Group by PR labels
- **Team**: Group by team ownership
- **User**: Group by PR author

#### Subgrouping

After selecting a primary group, you can add a secondary level of organization:

- Choose any remaining grouping option for further categorization
- Subgroups create a nested hierarchy within primary groups
- Select "None" to use only primary grouping

:::tip
Choose grouping options that match your team's workflow. For example:

- Use Repository → Team for large multi-team organizations
- Use User → Label to track individual contributions by type
- Use Team → Repository to monitor team activity across repos

:::

### Report Lifecycle Management

Control your reports through their entire lifecycle:

#### Editing Reports

- Make your desired changes to any configuration settings
- Click the **Save** button to apply your changes
- Changes take effect from the next scheduled run

:::tip
Remember to click **Save** when you're done making changes. Your modifications will be discarded if you navigate away without saving.
:::

#### Disabling Reports

- Toggle the **Active** switch to temporarily pause a report
- Disabled reports:
  - Maintain their configuration
  - Skip scheduled runs
  - Can be re-enabled at any time
  - Show "Disabled" status in the dashboard

#### Deleting Reports

- Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) next to the report
- Confirm deletion in the modal
- Note: This action is permanent and cannot be undone
- All report history and configuration will be removed

:::warning
Deleting a report will immediately stop all scheduled runs and remove access to historical reports. Consider disabling instead of deleting if you might need the report again.
:::

## Best Practices

1. **Scheduling**

   - Align report timing with your team's workflow
   - Consider timezone differences for distributed teams

2. **Content**

   - Keep prompts focused on actionable information
   - Use grouping to improve readability
   - Exclude unnecessary details that may create noise

3. **Distribution**
   - Use channels your team actively monitors
   - Consider creating separate reports for different audiences (e.g., management vs. development team)
