### Deleting the CodeRabbit Account via the UI

:::info

Only accounts where the user has admin access will be deleted.

:::

Sign into your CodeRabbit account and navigate to the **Subscription** page.

Select the orange colored **Delete Account** button just below the Manage
Subscription button. If you do not see the button, then likely you are not an
admin user for that specific organization. Upon selecting a organization which
as admin access, the button will appear.

A Modal informing the user about the result of deleting the account will open
upon selecting **Delete Account**. You can open the dropdowns for more
information.

<div align="center">
![Delete Account](/img/guides/delete_account_light.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![Delete Account](/img/guides/delete_account_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
</div>

Deletion will only occur once the admin specifically types in "delete" in the
input box provided.

You will be redirected to the login page once the account is deleted. Please
