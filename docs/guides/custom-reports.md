CodeRabbit Pro allows you to create custom reports tailored to your specific needs using a flexible prompt-based system. This guide will help you understand how to create effective custom reports.

## Understanding Custom Reports

Custom reports allow you to:

- Define exactly what information you want to see
- Specify the format and structure of the report
- Set custom filtering and grouping rules
- Generate reports in different languages

## Creating Custom Report Templates

### Basic Structure

A custom report template consists of instructions that tell CodeRabbit what information to include and how to present it. Here's a basic example:

```text
Please provide a summary of:
- All merged pull requests
- Critical bug fixes
- Code review discussions

Group by:
- Repository
- Team

Format using:
- Bullet points for changes
- Tables for statistics
```

### Example for different languages

Japanese:

```text
レポートを英語ではなく日本語で送信してください。

以下の要約を提供してください：
- すべてのプルリクエスト活動
- コードレビューの議論
```

French:

```text
Veuillez envoyer le rapport en français et non en anglais.

Veuillez fournir un résumé de :
- Toutes les activités de demandes de fusion
- Discussions sur la révision de code
```

### Available Data Points

Your custom reports can access the following PR information that you can reference in your prompts:

#### Pull Request Status

- `Merged`: boolean (true/false) - Whether the PR has been merged
- `Draft`: boolean (true/false) - Whether the PR is in draft state
- `State`: string ("open"/"closed") - Current state of the PR
- `Mergeable`: boolean (true/false) - Whether the PR can be merged
- `Is stale`: boolean - Whether PR has been inactive for over 168 hours

#### Basic Information

- `Pull request number`: number - The PR's identifier
- `Title`: string - PR title
- `URL`: string - Link to the PR
- `Author name`: string - PR creator's username
- `Created at`: datetime - When the PR was created
- `Last activity`: datetime - Most recent activity timestamp
- `Closed at`: datetime (if applicable) - When the PR was closed

#### Additional Context

- `Labels`: array of strings - All labels applied to the PR
- `Reviewers`: array of strings - Assigned reviewers' usernames
- `Description`: markdown - Full PR description
- `Summary`: string - AI-generated summary of changes
- `Comments`: array of objects
  - `username`: string - Comment author
  - `body`: markdown - Comment content

Here's an example prompt that uses these data points:

```text
Generate a summary with the following format for each PR:

## [PR Title](URL)
**Status**: {Use these symbols based on state}
- 🔀 if Merged is true
- 📝 if Draft is true
- 💬 if State is "open"
- 🔒 if State is "closed" and not merged
Add ⚠️ if Is stale is true

**Author**: {Author name}
**Created**: {Created at}
**Labels**: {Labels joined by commas}
**Reviewers**: {Reviewers joined by commas}

### Summary
{Summary limited to 50 words}

### Recent Activity
{List last 3 comments with username and content}
```

### Formatting Options

CodeRabbit supports markdown formatting in custom reports. You can use:

- Headers (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Lists (bullet points and numbered)
- Tables
- Code blocks
- Bold and italic text
- Links

### Headers and Titles

The name you give to each report in the CodeRabbit menu will be used for the first line of any report or the subject for emails. For example if your report is named `Executive Summary Template` then this string will appear on the subject of your emails and start of all message chains.

When using the `Preview Report` button in the CodeRabbit menu, the subject will begin with `Preview: <report name>`.

The reports will also have an overall title describing the report content such as `Pull Request Summary Report (January 2025)`.

To change these details of this overall title you should include specific instructions in your custom prompt with examples such as:

```text
- Do not add a date to the titles like "Pull Request Summary Report (January 2025)" it should just be "Pull Request Summary Report"
```

### Language Support

You can generate reports in multiple languages by specifying the ISO language code in your template. For example:

```text
Language: fr
Please provide a summary of:
- All pull request activities
- Code review discussions
```

## Advanced Features

### Filtering

Include specific filtering instructions in your template:

```text
Include only:
- PRs with "critical" or "bug" labels
- Changes to production code
- Reviews from senior developers

Exclude:
- Automated commits
- Documentation changes
- Dependencies updates
```

### Custom Grouping

Organize information using custom grouping rules:

```text
Group by:
1. Priority (High/Medium/Low)
2. Component (Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure)
3. Team (Team A/Team B)

Within each group, sort by:
- Activity date (newest first)
- Impact level
```

### Time-Based Analysis

Add temporal analysis to your reports:

```text
Provide:
- Week-over-week comparison
- Trend analysis for the past month
- Velocity metrics
- Time to merge statistics
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**

   - Clearly define what should be included/excluded
   - Use precise language to avoid ambiguity
   - Specify exact metrics you want to track

2. **Structure Matters**

   - Start with high-level summaries
   - Use consistent grouping patterns
   - Include clear section breaks

3. **Keep it Relevant**

   - Focus on actionable information
   - Avoid redundant data points
   - Consider your audience's needs

4. **Optimize Readability**

   - Use appropriate formatting
   - Include visual breaks
   - Maintain consistent styling

5. **Use Examples**
   - Include "do this" and "don't do this" examples (especially for titles)
   - Demonstrate proper formatting patterns
   - Show concrete use cases for different report types
   - Help maintain consistency across teams
   - Avoid ambiguity in report generation

## Example Templates

### Executive Summary Template

```text
Provide a high-level overview:
1. Key metrics:
   - Total PRs merged
   - Average review time
   - Code quality scores
2. Notable achievements
3. Blocking issues
4. Resource allocation

Format:
- Use tables for metrics
- Bullet points for achievements
- Clear headers for sections
```

### Technical Deep Dive Template

```text
Generate a detailed technical report:
1. Code changes:
   - Architecture updates
   - API modifications
   - Database changes
2. Testing coverage
3. Performance impacts
4. Security considerations

Include:
- Links to significant PRs
- Code snippets for major changes
- Technical debt analysis
```

### Advanced Formatting

Heres a more advanced example of a custom report template:

```text
Generate a report of all pull requests in the following format:

- As the first paragraph, start with "🟣" if merged, "⚫" if draft, "🟢" if open, "🔴" if closed
  - On the same line, add the PR title in bold (and only the title; don't put anything else in bold after that)
  - On the same line, add the PR browser link (do not use an api link)
  - On the same line, add the last activity date in the format "Day Month Year, Hour:Minute AM/PM (Timezone)" in italic (don't put anything else in italic after that and make sure it's not bold)
- Make a new bullet-point list of high-level changes in the PR
  - Start each change with a gitmoji followed by a very terse one-liner to mention at a high level what the change does and to what part of the application it applies to
  - Do not start with verbose non-speak such as "The pull request enhances" or "This PR introduces". Keep it terse and straight to the point. Start change descriptions with a verb
  - Do not end with justifications or reasons for the changes such as "... enhancing type safety". Stick to the facts, do not make up the outcome of a change
  - Limit to the 4 most relevant changes
  - Examples: "✨ Add a rotating tagline on the home page", "🔧 Add func-style to ESLint", "📝 Add download badge to `README.md`", "✅ Add unit tests for comment trees", "👷 Create a pipeline to publish to npmjs.org", "🐛 Fix comment submission in posts", "📄 License under AGPL-3.0-or-later", "📱 Change post view for mobile", "💄 Make sidebar links blue", "🩹 Fix unfollow button", "🔒️ Limit login cookies to a specific subdomain", "🥅 Handle errors when commenting in a post", "🙈 Stop ignoring `.env` and start ignoring `.env.local` and `.env.*.local`", "⬆️ Update lemmy-js-client to v0.19.4", "🏷️ Define interfaces for pull request events", "🔐 Add environment variables for Bitbucket Server", "🚚 Rename exported client instances in test files", "🏷️ Add type alias `EventKey` and its type guard `isEventKey`", "🏗️ Aggregate exports for pull request events in an index file"
- Start the next paragraph with "Blockers:" in bold
  - Summarize any issues preventing the PR from progressing
    - Some examples: "Waiting for merge", "Waiting for review", "Failing CI/CD", "Needs more tests", "Needs rebase", "@username is waiting for a response", etc.
  - If the PR is stale, note it here
- Do not add a "Report" heading
- Make sure there is one empty line between each paragraph

These are the available emojis and the type of change they represent. Do not using any other emoji. Make sure the change corresponds to the gitmoji.
