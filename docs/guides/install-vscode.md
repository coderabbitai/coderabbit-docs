This page is about installing the CodeRabbit VSCode extension. For more information about the extension, see
[Review local changes](/code-editors).

:::note
The instructions on this page are specific to using the extension with VSCode. If you are instead using a VSCode-compatible editor such as Cursor or Windsurf, then the steps that you need to follow are similar, but might require some adaptation.

## Before you begin

Before you can use the CodeRabbit VSCode extension, you need a CodeRabbit account.

If you don't already have an account, you can create one by visiting [the CodeRabbit login page](https://app.coderabbit.ai/login).

## Install the extension

To install the CodeRabbit VSCode extension, follow these steps:

1. Visit [the extension's page on the Visual Studio Marketplace](https://coderabbit.link/vscode-docs).

1. Click **Install**.

1. If your browser asks you for permission to open VSCode, then click **Allow** or its equivalent control.

1. A summary of the CodeRabbit VSCode extension appears in your VSCode window. If you would like VSCode to automatically check for and apply future updates to the extension, then keep the **Auto Update** checkbox selected.

1. In VSCode, click **Install**.

1. A **Log in to CodeRabbit to get started** dialog appears. Click **Login**. If the dialog gets dismissed or times out first, then you can follow these alternate steps:

   1. Click the CodeRabbit icon in the VSCode activity bar.

   1. Click the **Use CodeRabbit for Free** button.

1. Grant VSCode permission to open your browser, if asked.

1. In your web browser, log into your CodeRabbit account.

This connects your CodeRabbit account with the CodeRabbit VSCode extension.
