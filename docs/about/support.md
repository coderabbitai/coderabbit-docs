### Can CodeRabbit subscription be used across multiple organizations?

Subscription seats are tied to the specific GitHub/GitLab organization under
which they are purchased and cannot be used under another organization.

### Can CodeRabbit review my existing PRs after integrating it?

CodeRabbit would by default only review new PRs or existing PRs which have a new
commit after the app is installed. You can, however, use the
`@coderabbitai review` command on the PR to trigger a review of existing PRs.

### Who can add the repositories on CodeRabbit?

You need to be a GitHub/GitLab admin to add the repositories.

### Do I need my own OpenAI key with CodeRabbit Pro?

OpenAI cost is part of the subscription. There is no additional cost for OpenAI.

### What is the difference between CodeRabbit OSS and CodeRabbit Pro?

[`ai-pr-reviewer`](https://github.com/coderabbitai/ai-pr-reviewer) project is
our Open-Source Software (OSS) for pull request reviews. With CodeRabbit OSS,
you need your own OpenAI key, and you will incur OpenAI costs. On the other
hand, with a CodeRabbit Pro subscription, the OpenAI cost is included.
Additionally, CodeRabbit Pro offers advanced prompts and superior noise
reduction features, which are not present in CodeRabbit OSS.

### Can I use both CodeRabbit OSS and CodeRabbit Pro together?

You can, but this will result in duplicate reviews. We suggest you use only one
of the two.
