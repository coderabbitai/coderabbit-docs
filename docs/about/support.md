### What is the difference between CodeRabbit OSS ai-pr-reviewer and CodeRabbit Pro ?

ai-pr-reviewer is our Open Source Software (OSS) for pull request reviews. With CodeRabbit OSS, you need your own OpenAI key, and you will incur OpenAI costs.
On the other hand, with a CodeRabbit Pro subscription, the OpenAI cost is included. Additionally, CodeRabbit Pro offers advanced prompts and superior noise reduction features, which are not present in CodeRabbit OSS.

You can, but this will result in duplicate reviews. We suggest you use only one of the two.
