# CodeRabbit Roadmap

> CodeRabbit aims to exceed the quality of manual code reviews through applied AI. Here's our technical roadmap focusing on core improvements and integrations.

## AI Review Engine

### Context Understanding

- Deep parsing of repository structure and dependencies
- Improved detection of architectural patterns
- Enhanced framework-specific analysis for React, Next.js, and other major frameworks

### Code Analysis

- Static analysis integration with popular linters
- Advanced type checking for TypeScript codebases
- Security vulnerability scanning with OWASP guidelines

### Response Quality

- Concise, actionable review comments
- Automated code suggestions with proper typing
- Performance impact analysis of changes

## CI/CD Integration

> We are integrating various tool chains to enable coders and reviewers to have a consistent experience irrespective of the tools. The immediate tools would be:

- CircleCI
- Jenkins

## Team Collaboration

### Chat Integration

> Communication and the user experience of review via various communication tools will be key.

We will start with integrations to Slack and Microsoft Teams and will be diving into the design engineering of these flows further:

- **Slack**: Real-time notifications and interactive discussions
- **Microsoft Teams**: Code review conversations within the Microsoft ecosystem

### Review Workflow

> These are additional capabilities that can also be reviewed in the same PR to accelerate the coder and reviewer journey. This includes pipeline failure analysis and resolution, as well as vulnerability assessment.

- Automated review assignment
- Blocking checks configuration
- Custom review rules per repository

#### Pipeline Failure Analysis

- Automated analysis of CI/CD pipeline failures
- AI-driven suggestions for resolving issues
- Historical tracking of pipeline performance

### Finishing Touches

Finishing touches are about experience that often take developers time away from what they like doing best coding. But adding finishing touches is crucial and should follow the ontology and taxonomy. We will start by looking into specific areas such as documentation of code as an example.
