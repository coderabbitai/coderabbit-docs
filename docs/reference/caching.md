# Caching

CodeRabbit provides caching capabilities for code and dependencies to accelerate the review process. This feature enhances your development workflow by delivering faster feedback.

## Security and Privacy

- Cached data is encrypted (except for OSS projects)
- Cache expires after a maximum of one week
- Cached data is used exclusively for speeding up reviews

## Configuration

You can opt out of caching in two ways:

1. **Disable Cache**: Configure `Review - Disable Cache` at either:

   - Organization level
   - Repository level

2. **Disable Data Retention**: Turn off the `Data Retention` setting in your Organization Settings to disable all data retention across your organization.
