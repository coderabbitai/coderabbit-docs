This guide will assist you in effectively integrating CodeRabbit with Azure DevOps.

## Prerequisites

<ListItems
	items={[
		"An active Azure DevOps account",
		"Use of organizational email addresses is required; personal email addresses are not supported for this integration"
	]}
/>

## Integration Instructions

<ListItems
	orderedList
	items={[
		<>Log in to the CodeRabbitAI application</>,
		<>After logging in, you will be redirected to a page displaying Microsoft Apps consent requests. Please forward these requests to your administrator for approval.
		
		<Warning>
			If you are an administrator, you may approve the applications directly. If not, please contact your administrator to request approval for the applications.
		</Warning>

		<>Once your administrator has approved the applications, click "Continue"</>,
		<>You will be redirected to the "Onboarding" page, where you can select the organization you wish to integrate with</>,
		<>On the "Azure DevOps User" page, enter your Personal Access Token for Azure DevOps.

		<>To install CodeRabbit on a repository, toggle the switch on the "Repositories" page</>
	]}
/>

## How it works

For the CodeRabbit app to post reviews on merge requests, it needs to interact with the Azure DevOps API, which requires a Personal Access Token. This token can be generated by creating a Personal Access Token from one of your existing users.

You can create a new user in Azure DevOps and generate a Personal Access Token for that user, following [our recommendations](#recommendations).

## Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens

To interact with the Azure DevOps API, a **Personal Access Token** is required. This token can be generated by creating a **Personal Access Token** from one of your existing users.

Upon first login to the application (immediately after the onboarding screen), you will need to add the Personal Access Token.

### Recommendations

<ListItems
	items={[
		<><strong>Create a dedicated user for CodeRabbit</strong> - This ensures the user is exclusively for CodeRabbit, allowing better access control</>,
		<><strong>Use "CodeRabbit" as the username</strong> - This makes the user easily recognizable for future reference</>,
		<><strong>Use a dedicated email address</strong> - This helps in easy identification and management</>,
		<><strong>Use the CodeRabbit logo as the profile picture</strong> - This further ensures easy recognition. You can download our logo from <a href="/img/integrations/logo.png">here</a></>
	]}
/>

### Key Points to Remember

<ListItems
	items={[
		<>Personal access tokens have expiration dates. Ensure the expiration date covers the duration of your intended use of the CodeRabbit app</>,
		<>Code reviews will be attributed to the owner of the personal access token</>,
		<>If the personal access token expires, you can add a new one via the CodeRabbit UI:
		<ListItems
			nested
			items={[
				<>Navigate to the "AzureDevOps User" page in the sidebar</>,
				<>Add the new token and click save</>
			]}
		/></>
	]}
/>

### Generating a Personal Access Token

Azure DevOps provides an option to generate a personal access token for a user. Follow these steps to generate the token:

<ListItems
	orderedList
	items={[
		<>Log in as the user intended for CodeRabbit reviews</>,
		<>Next to your avatar on the headers right side is a settings icon, click it</>,
		<>Choose "Personal Access Tokens"</>,
		<>Click "New Token"</>,
		<>Select the organization you want to use the token with or select "All accessible organizations"</>,
		<>Enter a name and an expiry date for the token</>,
		<>We need to have read & write access to "Work Items" & "Code" to post reviews on pull requests. If you are on the Pro tier also add "Build" access for pipeline failure remediation</>,
		<>Click "Create"</>
	]}
/>
