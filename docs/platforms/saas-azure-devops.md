This guide will assist you in effectively integrating CodeRabbit with SaaS Azure DevOps.

## How it works

For the CodeRabbit app to post reviews on merge requests, it needs to interact with the Azure DevOps API, which requires a Personal Access Token. This token can be generated by creating a Personal Access Token from one of your existing users.

You can create a new user in Azure DevOps and generate a Personal Access Token for that user, following [our recommendations](#recommendations).

## Azure DevOps Personal Access Tokens

To interact with the Azure DevOps API, a **Personal Access Token** is required. This token can be generated by creating a **Personal Access Token** from one of your existing users.

Upon first login to the application (immediately after the onboarding screen), you will need to add the Personal Access Token.

#### Recommendations

* **Create a dedicated user for CodeRabbit** - This ensures the user is exclusively for CodeRabbit, allowing better access control.
* **Use "CodeRabbit" as the username** - This makes the user easily recognizable for future reference.
* **Use a dedicated email address** - This helps in easy identification and management.
* **Use the CodeRabbit logo as the profile picture** - This further ensures easy recognition. You can download our logo from [here](/img/integrations/logo.svg "download").

#### Key Points to Remember

* Personal access tokens have expiration dates. Ensure the expiration date covers the duration of your intended use of the CodeRabbit app.
* Code reviews will be attributed to the owner of the personal access token.
* If the personal access token expires, you can add a new one via the CodeRabbit UI:
  * Navigate to the "AzureDevOps User" page in the sidebar.
  * Add the new token and click save.

### Generating a Personal Access Token

Azure DevOps provides an option to generate a personal access token for a user. Follow these steps to generate the token:

1. Log in as the user intended for CodeRabbit reviews.
2. Next to your avatar on the headers right side is a settings icon, click it.
3. Choose "Personal Access Tokens"
4. Click "New Token"
5. Select the organization you want to use the token with or select "All accessible organizations."
6. Enter a name and an expiry date for the token.
7. We need read & write access to "Work Items" & "Code" to post reviews on pull requests.
8. Click "Create"
