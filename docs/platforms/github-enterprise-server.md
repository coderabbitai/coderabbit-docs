:::info

This page is for GitHub Enterprise Server (Self-Hosted) users only.  
If you're using github.com, [log in to CodeRabbit](https://app.coderabbit.ai)
and add your repositories from there

:::

This page guides you through the process of integrating your Self-Managed GitHub
with CodeRabbit.

To initiate the integration, we require specific information. This is essential
for the initial setup of CodeRabbit within your domain. Once this setup is
complete, you can log in directly.

### **Step 1: Getting Started**

**Visit CodeRabbit:** Visit our [Login](https://coderabbit.ai/login) page and
select Self-Hosted GitHub

On this page, enter the URL of your self-managed GitHub instance and click
submit. Once, you submit, we check our database for a record of your
organization and if we find an existing one, we will start the login process.

If the self-managed GitHub instance is not found, you will be required to enter
more details for the onboarding.
