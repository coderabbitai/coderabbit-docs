# Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration

## Overview

This phase establishes the foundational configuration for the changelog system, including Docusaurus plugin setup, routing configuration, and redirect infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

- Docusaurus 3.x installed
- `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects` package available
- TypeScript configuration for type safety

## Actual Implementation vs Plan

### Key Differences:

1. **Plugin Installation**: Had to explicitly install `@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs@3.6.1` to avoid version conflicts with the preset-classic package
2. **Prebuild Scripts**: Temporarily removed from package.json since the validation scripts don't exist yet
3. **Placeholder Component**: Created a minimal ChangelogItem component to allow the server to start
4. **Environment Configuration**: Skipped the `.env.changelog` file as it wasn't immediately necessary

## Technical Implementation

### 1.1 Install Required Dependencies

**Original Plan:**
```bash
pnpm add @docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects
```

**Actual Implementation:**
```bash
# @docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects was already installed
# Had to add the docs plugin to match core version:
pnpm add @docusaurus/plugin-content-docs@3.6.1
```

**Why:** The project already had the redirects plugin. However, we encountered a version mismatch error because the preset-classic package includes a different version of the docs plugin. We needed to explicitly install the matching version.

### 1.2 Create Changelog Plugin Configuration

**Implemented as planned** ✅

The configuration was added exactly as specified in the plan. The plugin configuration includes:
- Unique ID: `'changelog'` to distinguish from main docs
- Custom route: `/changelog`
- Separate sidebar configuration file
- Custom DocItem component for future customization

### 1.3 Create Sidebar Configuration

**Implemented as planned** ✅

Created `sidebarsChangelog.ts` exactly as specified. This configuration will automatically generate sidebar items from all markdown files in the changelog directory.

### 1.4 Update Navbar Configuration

In `docusaurus.config.ts`, ensure the navbar includes the changelog link:

```typescript
navbar: {
  items: [
    // ... existing items
    {
      label: 'Changelog',
      position: 'left',
      to: '/changelog',
    },
  ],
},
```

**Already implemented** ✅ - The navbar already contained a changelog link in the configuration, so no changes were needed.

### 1.5 Configure Redirects Infrastructure

**Already configured** ✅

The `@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects` plugin was already installed and configured in the project with numerous existing redirects. We'll add the changelog-specific redirects in Phase 2 after content migration.

### 1.6 Create Directory Structure

**Implemented as planned** ✅

All directories were created successfully:

```bash
mkdir -p changelog
mkdir -p src/components/ChangelogItem
mkdir -p src/components/TimelineSidebar
mkdir -p src/css/changelog
mkdir -p static/img/changelog
```

### 1.7 TypeScript Types

**Implemented as planned** ✅

Created `src/types/changelog.ts` with all specified interfaces:

```typescript
export interface ChangelogFrontMatter {
	title: string
	date: string
	slug: string
	tags: string[]
	heroImage?: string
	author?: string
	authorImage?: string
	summary?: string
	hide_table_of_contents?: boolean
}

export interface ChangelogEntry {
	id: string
	metadata: ChangelogFrontMatter
	content: string
	permalink: string
}

export interface ChangelogListProps {
	limit?: number
	tag?: string
	year?: string
}
```

### 1.8 Configure Global Styles

**Implemented as planned** ✅

Created `src/css/changelog/index.css` with all specified styles:

```css
/* Root changelog styles */
:root {
	--changelog-timeline-color: #e1e4e8;
	--changelog-timeline-dot-color: var(--ifm-color-primary);
	--changelog-timeline-dot-size: 12px;
	--changelog-timeline-line-width: 2px;
	--changelog-hero-height: 300px;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
	--changelog-timeline-color: #30363d;
}

/* Hide ToC for all changelog pages */
.theme-doc-page[data-changelog="true"] .theme-doc-toc-desktop,
.theme-doc-page[data-changelog="true"] .theme-doc-toc-mobile {
	display: none;
}

/* Adjust content width when ToC is hidden */
.theme-doc-page[data-changelog="true"] .theme-doc-markdown {
	max-width: 100%;
}
```

**Implemented as planned** ✅

Added import to `src/css/custom.css`:

```css
@import "./changelog/index.css";
```

### 1.9 Environment Configuration

**Not implemented** ❌

**Why:** Skipped for now as environment variables aren't immediately necessary for the basic setup. Will be added when implementing RSS feed and pagination features in later phases.

### 1.10 Build Script Updates

**Partially implemented** ⚠️

Added the changelog scripts to `package.json`:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"changelog:validate": "node scripts/validate-changelog.js",
		"changelog:build-redirects": "node scripts/build-changelog-redirects.js"
	}
}
```

**Difference:** Did not add the `prebuild` script that would run these automatically because:
1. The validation and redirect scripts don't exist yet (will be created in Phase 2)
2. Adding prebuild hooks that fail would prevent the development server from starting
3. These will be added once the scripts are implemented

## Additional Implementation Details

### Placeholder Components Created

**ChangelogItem Component** (`src/components/ChangelogItem/index.tsx`):
```typescript
import React from 'react';
import DocItem from '@theme/DocItem';
import type {Props} from '@theme/DocItem';

// Placeholder component - will be fully implemented in Phase 3
export default function ChangelogItem(props: Props): JSX.Element {
  return <DocItem {...props} />;
}
```

**Why:** The `docItemComponent` configuration requires this component to exist. Created a minimal wrapper around the default DocItem to allow the server to start.

### Placeholder Content Created

**Changelog Index** (`changelog/index.md`):
```markdown
---
title: Changelog
hide_table_of_contents: true
---

# Changelog

Welcome to the CodeRabbit changelog! This page will showcase our latest updates, features, and improvements.

<!-- Placeholder content - will be replaced with custom React components in Phase 3 -->
```

**Why:** Docusaurus requires at least one markdown file in the configured path to avoid build errors.

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Changelog route `/changelog` resolves without 404
- [x] Navbar shows Changelog link with correct styling
- [x] Plugin configuration doesn't conflict with main docs
- [x] TypeScript types compile without errors
- [x] Directory structure created successfully
- [x] CSS imports work correctly
- [ ] Build process includes new validation scripts (deferred to Phase 2)

## Summary of Phase 1 Completion

### What Was Achieved:
1. ✅ Successfully configured multi-instance docs plugin for changelog
2. ✅ Created all required directory structures
3. ✅ Set up TypeScript types for future development
4. ✅ Configured CSS infrastructure with proper variable definitions
5. ✅ Created minimal placeholder components to test configuration
6. ✅ Resolved plugin version conflicts
7. ✅ Verified changelog route works correctly

### Key Differences from Plan:
1. **Plugin Installation**: Required explicit version matching due to preset conflicts
2. **Placeholder Components**: Added minimal implementations to allow testing
3. **Environment Config**: Deferred until needed for specific features
4. **Build Scripts**: Added script definitions but not prebuild hooks (pending script creation)

### Ready for Phase 2:
The foundation is now in place to begin content migration and structure implementation. The changelog section is accessible at `/changelog` and ready for content.
